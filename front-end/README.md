# Front End Coding Test

For the assessment we’ll be building out a responsive static html page that matches the designs here: https://www.figma.com/design/oVC5v6aSlO2MhbQEobgzn2/old-pricing-page?node-id=0-1 (If you have any issues with the Figma link please use the images in the examples folder.) We have included an empty JavaScript file and set up TailwindCSS in the build process. We want to see you write HTML and JavaScript from scratch as much as possible while leaning on TailwindCSS for styling. 

Please fork this repository and let us know the link to your version when you are done.

As you’ll see in the designs, there are three viewport sizes included, we do want to see all three working in what you produce.

Links and buttons don’t have to lead anywhere, but we would like to see the hamburger menu functioning, this is a chance to showcase some JS skills. The FAQ section links should also show and hide some lorem ipsum content.

Additionally, for both tablet and mobile viewport sizes, please use JavaScript to add an appropriate class ‘tablet’ or ‘mobile’ to all buttons.

Double and triple check that everything looks good, and feel free to add comments in code or a README.txt in this folder to explain your approach if you’d like.

Email a link back to your repository for us to review. We should be able to clone it locally, run the http-server and verify the project in a browser to your work looking good and responsive.

You have 48 hours from now to return this exercise back to us. Good luck, and feel free to reach out with any questions!
