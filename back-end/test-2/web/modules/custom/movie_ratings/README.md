## Setup and Testing Instructions

Execute the following commands in your local development environment:

```bash
ddev start
ddev composer install
ddev drush site:install --account-name=admin --account-pass=admin -y
ddev launch
```

---

### Configuration Import and UUID Mismatch Fix

After the site install, running configuration import may produce a UUID mismatch error due to the site already being installed but config having a different UUID.

To fix:

1. Obtain the UUID from your sync config at `config/sync/system.site.yml`.

2. Run:

```bash
ddev drush cset system.site uuid "44d8ad9e-a5ec-4a52-aa6a-f750294a3fe3"  # Replace with your actual UUID
ddev drush cim
ddev drush cr
```

---

### Import Dummy Content

Import dummy movie content for testing:

```bash
ddev drush migrate:import --group="movie_migration"
```

---

### Verify Content and Features

- Navigate to `/movies` to see the main movie listing with filters.
- Sidebar contains blocks for popular movies and highest rated movies.
- Visit individual movie pages to view ratings and submit your own rating via the rating form.
